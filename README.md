Reflection on Project Management Tools

GitHub's project management tools are invaluable for managing the development of an e-commerce website. Milestones provide a structured way to define critical phases, like launching the MVP. Issues allow us to track bugs, feature requests, and tasks with clarity, ensuring that every aspect of the project is addressed. The project board serves as a visual dashboard, helping the team monitor progress and stay aligned.

These tools improve collaboration by assigning responsibilities and tracking progress transparently. One challenge might be ensuring the team consistently updates the project board and issues, which can be managed with regular standups. Overall, these tools enhance communication, organization, and productivity, ensuring the successful delivery of the project.
