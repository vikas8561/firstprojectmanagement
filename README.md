---> Reflection on Project Management Tools

GitHub's project management tools are invaluable for managing the development of an e-commerce website. Milestones provide a structured way to define critical phases, like launching the MVP. Issues allow us to track bugs, feature requests, and tasks with clarity, ensuring that every aspect of the project is addressed. The project board serves as a visual dashboard, helping the team monitor progress and stay aligned.

These tools improve collaboration by assigning responsibilities and tracking progress transparently. One challenge might be ensuring the team consistently updates the project board and issues, which can be managed with regular standups. Overall, these tools enhance communication, organization, and productivity, ensuring the successful delivery of the project.


---> Issue 1: Add a payment gateway integration

Linked to Milestone: MVP Launch
Reason for Choosing:
A payment gateway is a core feature of the e-commerce website. Without it, customers cannot complete purchases, making this feature critical for achieving the MVP milestone. It ensures secure transactions and enables the site to function as a fully operational e-commerce platform.
---> Issue 2: Design the product detail page UI

Linked to Milestone: MVP Launch
Reason for Choosing:
The product detail page is one of the most important parts of the user experience. It allows users to view product information, images, and prices and add items to their cart. This issue directly contributes to the usability and visual appeal of the MVP, ensuring customers can browse and interact with products effectively.

---> How They Contribute to the Milestone:
Both issues are essential for delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) because they focus on functionality (payment gateway) and user experience (product detail page).
Together, they provide critical capabilities:
Payment gateway: Enables transaction processing.
Product detail page: Facilitates user engagement with products.
